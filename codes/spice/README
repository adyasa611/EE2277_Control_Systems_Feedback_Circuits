1:Make sure that feedback.net file and LM741.MOD are in the same folder.
2:cd into the folder containing the above files.

***********THEORY***************
For the verifying DC Gain...
We give a DC input of 1 in ngspice.
DC gain = Vout/Vin (for DC value of input)
Since Vin=1 
Dc gain = Vout

***********SIMULATION************
We write the commands in the specified format in ngspice.
Now set the simulation to .op (operating point) (NOTE:- SINCE WE ARE DOING DC ANALYSIS)
always end the netlist with .end command

***********VERIFYING***************
We can notice that V(vo)= 5.005334
But the calculated value of DC gain is 5

***********ERROR ANALYSIS**********
ERROR in DC GAIN = 5-5.005334 = -0.005334
Thus, the calculated value and the simulation value are almost same.
