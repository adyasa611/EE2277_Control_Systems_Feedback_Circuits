1:Make sure that feedback.net file and LM741.MOD are in the same folder.
2:cd into the folder containing the above files.
3:Io value is printed in the terminal as vib#branch.

***********OBSERVATION***************
Io is printed as vib#branch
To measure current in a branch, keep a DC voltage source of 0 V in that
branch. This source is named vib, the current in the branch is
represented by vib#branch.
We observe that Io = 3.003266e-03
Thus, the calculated value and the simulation value are almost same.
